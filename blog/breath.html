        <h3>When Breath Becomes Air takes us through the personal reflections of Paul Kalanithi as he nears the end of his life. Kalanithi was close to becoming a practicing surgeon, but the discovery of a malignant cancer in his brain uprooted all of his previous plans. It’s true that things never really turn out exactly the way we expect it to. However, it’s hard to imagine being diagnosed with a brain tumor at a young age. <br />
            <br>
            One of the quotes that struck me early on was: “If the unexamined life is not worth living, was the unlived life worth examining?” This brings up the question: What makes life meaningful? It’s a question that we all eventually grapple with, especially when our identity and life are threatened.<br />
            <br>
            <b>1. Meaning In Our Lives</b> <br />
            <br>
            Kalanithi illustrates the importance of meaning in our life by making a distinction between a body and a being. I found that the images evoked from the words: bodies, organs, and air to be striking in the sense that they lacked a human quality. We’ve reduced a person, objectified it, and stripped it of meaning. The contrasting set of words would be: being and breath.<br />
            <br>
            In his reflections, Paul Kalanithi recognizes that health is more than a doctor’s diagnosis. Seeing a body as just “matter and mechanism” is the opposite of connecting with your patients and understanding their suffering. For Kalanithi, being a surgeon and a doctor was not really saving lives, but rather more acting as a guide, helping families understand what death entailed. Kalanithi recognized that medications, proper indicators and complicated scientific terms were not that meaningful for a person who was suffering and afraid of doing a complicated surgery. In other words, each day he had to think differently about how to approach patients. One surgery, for example resulted in the loss of the ability to communicate. He writes “the patient becomes an isolate, something central to her humanity stolen forever”. After all, how can one live without agency - the ability to express oneself easily and keep in touch with those who love you? <br />
            <br>
            So what give meaning to our lives? Just living and being physically healthy is only part of the picture. I’d say that a sense of purpose is an important ingredient in the recipe. Similarly, Darwin and Nietzsche argue - striving is what makes us human. Meaning, though, also comes the ability to realize your dreams. It also comes from connecting with others and being a part of a strong community. Over all, meaning and health have multiple dimensions.<br />
            <br>
            <b>2. Science vs Life</b> <br />
            <br>
            “Science is based on reproducibility and manufactured objectivity”. The central aspects of life include: hope, fear, love, suffering, envy, honor, etc. The application of science to human meaning seems incompatible with the subjective, unpredictable, and visceral nature of human life. <br />
            <br>
            <b>3. All About Attitude</b> <br />
            <br>
            Halfway through the book, I began to ask “well how does one go about one’s day knowing that death always wins and the deck is stacked against you?” After all, even if doctors do everything right and are perfect with all surgeries, the world is not. I think part of it is about is trying to maintain the right attitude. You have to stay optimistic and positive. One insight Kalanithi provides is believing “in an asymptote toward which you are ceaselessly striving”.  One thing I learned from a global health course is that global health is about endlessly striving to organize efforts against wicked problems. This requires sustained efforts that will not end and an understanding that new risks may arise. But that’s just the way it is because health is not just about disease control. Health is about tackling social problems that are not only unique, but often resemble symptoms of other problems. The <a href="https://www.un.org/sustainabledevelopment/sustainable-development-goals/">challenges</a> we face such as eliminating poverty and ensuring universal access to education demonstrate that extreme complexity is not the exception, but the rule. </h3>

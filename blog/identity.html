        <h3>Akerlof and Kranton add identity to the notion of tastes and highlight the importance of different social contexts in evaluating an individual’s preferences. In particular, their focus is on how people think they should behave, what rules society have and how people are motivated by these views. Although society’s norms are not always explicit, they are largely internalized and deeply held. <br />
            <br>
            We have come a long way from the idea of an individual as simply an optimizing human with economic motivations. However, decision making is complex and the previous definition is rigid and does not take into account human passions and social institutions. With utility, economists have generally maintained the idea that tastes are individual characteristics independent of social context. However, people have varying notions of who they are in different social contexts.<br />
            <br>
            So, to get a more accurate understanding of human behavior, we look to social categories, which refers to how a person sees him or herself at the time. This is partly of their own making (people have some choice over their identity). So we first try to figure out a person’s social category and then see what the norms for that category. Finally, we propose individual gains and losses from decisions, given these identities and norms (gain when conform and loss when not). Perhaps this may be the enjoyment people experience when they fit in with a group. These gains and losses add to the richness of standard economic analysis.<br />
            <br>
            <b>How does this inform our understanding of the world? </b> <br />
            <br>
            <ul>
                <li>
                    When employees identify with the firm and when their norms advance its goals, the company benefits. We want the case where a person doesn't just joining a company, but an institution with a distinguished character and history which hopefully they will maintain and perpetuate. An insider loses identity utility when putting in a low amount of effort. An outsider loses identity utility when he/she works really hard, but doesn’t feel a part of the company. Therefore, the company would probably end up compensating with a higher wage. Instilling identity is cheaper than having extreme wage differentials. One good place to look to is the military! They mainly award medals, not bonuses. Key: how can we create a common identity and align the goals of workers and management?
                </li>

                <li>
                    People behave differently when reminded of their racial, ethnic, and gender identities (“priming”). In one study, when a caste was primed, the low-caste subjects solved 23% fewer mazes. Wow.
                </li>

                <li>
                    If incentives are just monetary rewards and economic goals, people will game the system (focus on price) if they can get away with it. Conflict of interest is gone when you focus on insiders with goals matching that of the organization. Managers play a critical role in making workers feel like insiders.
                </li>

                <li>
                    Jobs that have gender tags lead to decrease in identity utility when the ‘wrong’ gender occupies the job. We should work to remove gender tags from jobs to fight discrimination. Firemen to firefighters. Policemen to police officers. 
                </li>
            </ul>
            <br>
            Over all, this book was really insightful because it makes you think about the social context for behaviors and the values that social institutions instill and reinforce. The values are present when people weigh the tradeoffs and they impact peoples' decision making. </h3>
